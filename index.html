         <p>
            Hello! My name is Bryce Teague Gounden and I am from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. I enjoy playing and
            watching soccer. My favorite team is Liverpool and my favorite player of all time is Steven Gerrard. I love
            listening to music and relaxing.
            I am currently studying at BYU Pathway and I am studying Web Design and Development. I am very excited about
            learning more.

        <p>
            KwaZulu-Natal, a coastal South African province, is known for its beaches, mountains and savannah populated by big game. 
            The safari destination Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, in the northeast, is home to black and white rhinos, lions and giraffes. 
            Durban is an Indian-influenced harbor city and a popular surfing spot. Cultural villages around the town of Eshowe showcase 
            the traditions of the indigenous Zulu people.
